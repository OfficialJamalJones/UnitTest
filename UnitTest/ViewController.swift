//Task : Re-define what a “test” is, for assignments.

//1. Why do we need unit testing? Unit testing ensures that all code meets quality standards before it's deployed. This ensures a reliable engineering environment where quality is paramount.

//2. What are the benefits of unit tests? Over the course of the product development life cycle, unit testing saves time and money, and helps developers write better code, more efficiently.

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }
